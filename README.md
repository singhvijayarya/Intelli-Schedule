🧠 Intelli-Schedule
AI-Powered Automated Timetable Generator for NEP-2020 Programs

A smart, scalable, and conflict-free timetable generation system built to meet the complex academic structures introduced under National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.
Intelli-Schedule automates timetable creation for Four-Year Undergraduate Programmes (FYUP), B.Ed., M.Ed., ITEP, and other multidisciplinary courses — removing manual errors, faculty clashes, and scheduling inefficiencies.

🚀 Why Intelli-Schedule?

With NEP-2020, higher education institutions now offer:

Flexible, credit-based structures

Major / Minor / Skill-Based / Ability Enhancement / Value-Added courses

Increased elective choices and interdisciplinary pathways

Manually creating timetables under this structure has become extremely complex, involving:

Multiple electives per student

Variable credit hours

Faculty workload distribution

Room/lab availability

Teaching practice schedules

Fieldwork, internships & project slots

Most colleges still rely on manual committees → resulting in clashes, non-optimized schedules, and underutilized resources.

🧩 Solution Overview

Intelli-Schedule is an AI/ML-assisted intelligent timetable generation system that automatically produces optimized, conflict-free timetables.

It integrates:

👩‍🎓 Student data (elective choices, credit load)

📘 Curriculum structure (lecture/tutorial/practical split)

👨‍🏫 Faculty data (availability, workload, specialization)

🏫 Room/Lab availability (capacity, type)

📅 Teaching practice & internship schedules

🔄 Real-time updates and scenario simulation
